# @ShrimpingIt Project Resources

This is a collection of resources including vector graphics and software sketches supporting the adopters of projects developed by [@ShrimpingIt](http://shrimping.it).

## Sketchbook 

The **'sketchbook'** folder contains software, known by the Arduino community as 'sketches' intended to be uploaded to the circuits when they are complete. The libraries required by our projects are distributed within the same sketchbook folder for your convenience. Thanks to all the library authors! We couldn't do it without you.

## Vector Graphics

The **'vector'** folder contains graphics depicting our circuit designs, which learners and educators can refer to when building the projects. These files are produced using a piece of [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) software called [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) which is free to download and install.

## Uploading Our Sketches to your Shrimp

To upload code to a @ShrimpingIt project, you must **first install the Arduino IDE**, which you can find [here](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). 

**UART drivers should be installed** so the USB device you use for programming can be identified by your computer. (drivers for our CP2102-based USB UARTs are [here](http://shrimping.it/drivers/) ).

Download this repository as a zip by clicking [here](https://github.com/ShrimpingIt/projects/archive/master.zip)

After unzipping the 'sketchbook' folder to your preferred location on your computer, launch the Arduino IDE and change your sketchbook location in *File=>Preferences* to point to the folder. If you already have a Sketchbook folder with sketches you want to keep, then drag the 'sketchbook/shrimpingit' folder into your sketchbook, and also drag the folders inside 'sketchbook/library/' into your own sketchbook's 'library' folder.

Roughly this means if... 
* you're an educator or learner, or you're distributing kits to others at cost, knock yourself out (crediting @ShrimpingIt and allowing others to remix your work). 
* you're a company selling kits for profit and you want to include the resources we've designed and shared to improve your customers' experience, then [get in touch](http://shrimping.it).

## Issues, Bugs, Requests

We invite those experimenting with our projects to [report any issues they find](https://github.com/ShrimpingIt/projects/issues). This means we can improve the experience for future learners.
